# MCS-BASIC-52 Single Board Computer
Single Board Computer with Intel's MCS-BASIC-52. Although schematic shows an Analog Devices/Maxim DS803C323 MCU, any MCU that is pin compatible with the 8052 should work.
Due to the changes I've made to the firmware, alas, the object code no longer fits into an 8K EPROM. Hence the use of a 27256 EPROM. Assemble the source with the [Macro Assembler AS](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/)
